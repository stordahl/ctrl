# ctrl: a tool for managing executive dysfunction

ctrl is a temporary to-do list with an integrated mechanism built to assist people living with executive dysfunction, in completing necessary tasks in a sustainable &amp; healthy manner.

## motivations

This app was inspired by TikTok user @danidonovan , who laid out this methodology for accomplishing tasks if you live with executive dysfunction. The idea is that you make a list of tasks and assign each of those tasks a specified number of sides on your dice based on the task's priority to you. You then roll the dice to determine which task you will complete first. The dice roll will fall within the range of sides for one of the tasks; this it the task you will complete! The goal of this app is to provide a digital tool to facilitate this exercise. You can find the TikTok explaining this concept [here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJbG48w5/)

## basic mechanics

There are two section in ctrl; the dice operator and the task record. Users should first add however many tasks they want to accomplish to the task record. Then we can move to the priority dropdown: located next to each text input in the task item. this number corresponds to a number of sides on the dice. For example, if I set my first task to 5, I will complete this task if I roll anywhere from 1 to 5. The more sides you assign to a given task, the higher the priority is.
